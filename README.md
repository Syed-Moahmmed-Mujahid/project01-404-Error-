# 404 Error Page

This is a simple and creative 404 error page made with HTML and CSS.  
It shows a friendly message when a page is not found.

## My Experience

This is my first front-end project.  
I learned how to use HTML and CSS to make a nice web page.  
It was fun and helped me understand the basics of web design.
